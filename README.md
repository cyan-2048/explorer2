Explorer knockoff
========

issues: 

- got rid of most of the design coz library cleaning... so yeah i need to polish the design i just kinda have no time for that yet....
- the new animations might glitch something when pressing stuff too fast...

added features: 
 - I tested my implementation of navigation i guess....
 - now the app remembers which folder/file was last focused in the current session.

todo:
 - add better icons
 - add softkeys

~~I'll get rid of those jquery stuff next... (don't think it's necessary with such simple stuff that vanilla js can do...)~~

lmao that was so easy i didn't even need to commit yet... like bruh wtf why would you need all of these libraries makes absolutely no sense to use stuff that you can simply do with vanilla js....
